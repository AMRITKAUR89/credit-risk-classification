## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to evaluate machine learning models for predicting loan outcomes, focusing on identifying healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1). This analysis aimed to help the company mitigate financial risks by accurately classifying high-risk loans.

The goal of this analysis was to evaluate machine learning models for predicting loan outcomes, focusing on identifying healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1). This analysis aimed to help the company mitigate financial risks by accurately classifying high-risk loans.

### Dataset Overview
- Financial Information: The dataset contained information about loan applicants, including loan features and risk status.
- Prediction Goal: Predict whether a loan is high-risk (1) or healthy (0).
- Target Variable: loan_status
- Distribution:
  - - 0 (Healthy Loans): Majority class.
- - 1 (High-Risk Loans): Minority class.

### Stages of Machine Learning Process
- Data Preparation:

Cleaned and preprocessed data to handle missing values and imbalances.
Split data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.
Model Training:

Applied Logistic Regression as the primary classification algorithm.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to determine how well it predicts both loan categories.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
